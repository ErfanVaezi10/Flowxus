"""
Project: Flowxus
Author: Erfan Vaezi

Purpose:
--------
Map repair rule ids to fixer implementations and provide a stable execution order.

Main Tasks:
-----------
   - Bind ids to fix functions via `FixSpec`.
   - Publish FIXERS (id â†’ spec) and ORDER (deterministic sequence).

Notes:
------
   - Topology fixes precede orientation.
   - Fixer signature: fn(mesh, finding_dict, rule_cfg) -> {"applied","waived","notes"}.
   - Registry is extendable; duplicate ids should be avoided upstream.
